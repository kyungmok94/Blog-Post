1- Understand your business

We investigated whether North America is a better place for software developers to immigrate than Europe.

To do this, we need to understand what is important to people looking for a new job. Payrolls, salary increases, and satisfaction with what they do are important factors that determine which position is a better choice.

To this end, we asked three questions:
- Where is the highest salary?
- Which region has the highest salary increase rate?
- Which place has the highest experience satisfaction?

2- Understanding Data

Rows are different respondents to the survey and columns are the answers to the survey questions. This includes data provided by numbers, categoricals, and text. Missing values and outliers.

3- Data Preparation

Data was collected and evaluated for data preparation steps, then data cleanup was carried out using the Python library of Numpy and Panda to focus on columns of interest.

4-Data Modeling

We graphed various behaviors related to three questions with Python library Matplot Ribs and Seabons.

5- Evaluation of results

For three questions, we have reached the following conclusion.
- Where is the highest salary? North America
- Which region has the highest salary increase rate? Both follow similar patterns.
- Which place has the highest experience satisfaction? They start the same way in their first year of work, but Europe is less satisfied. It's only 20 years before you can truly recover.

Finally, readme format:

-Used libraries: Numpy, Panda, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

-Motivation for the project: Recently, the number of immigrants has increased, and I wanted to analyze the data where it's good.
 
 I included a zip file in the survey_results_public.csv file used as a dataset. Also, the code file is Blog_post.ipynb and is summarized briefly in README.
